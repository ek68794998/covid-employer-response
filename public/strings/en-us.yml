  whatIs: "**{app}** ({appFullName}) is a collaborative, open-source project designed to track the responses of employers to the [coronavirus]({covidWikiUrl}) (COVID-19) [pandemic of 2019&ndash;2020]({pandemicWikiUrl}). It is built using information sourced from a number of places and categorizes it based on how reliable the original information source is considered to be. For more information, please visit [the project's page on GitHub]({githubUrl})."

  reportsAndClaims: |
    An **employer claim** is one or more declarations about an employer which include a summary and citations to back it up. This appears as a single bullet-point in the employer's listing beneath a header such as "{publication}".
    An **employer report** is a collection of claims about an employer as well as an overall rating of how well that employer has handled the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
  claimProcessing: Once a claim is submitted, it must be reviewed by a contributor to the project before it will be approved and appear on the site. This review process will require the contributor to go through each of the sources and validate that the claim made is substantiated by the source. Once the submitter and contributor(s) agree on the submitted information, the claim is completed and will appear the next time the site is updated.
  submitClaims: To submit a claim change of any kind, please click the "{submit}" link in the navigation menu. From there, ou can either submit a request for someone to update our data files, or submit a GitHub pull request to update the files yourself.
  citationTypes: |
    - {publication}: {publicationDescription}
    - {statement}: {statementDescription}
    - {hearsay}: {hearsayDescription}
  employerRatings: Ratings are algorithmically determined based on the positivity and negativity of the claims that it has. Claims that are more safety-critical have a higher weight than those which are not, and thus are not factored as heavily.
