summary: As an essential retail chain, Walmart must remain open amidst the pandemic. During the early stages of the pandemic, employees were not able to call in sick as they fear getting fired  and they are overworked due to the panic buying. Since then however, the company has responded to the pandemic by making substantial changes to its operation such as introducing one-way aisles, ensuring that all workers coming in to work are healthy, provide masks and gloves for its employees, and keeping customers and staff apart in stores. However, some stores have questionable practices, causing customers to be corraled in groups, potentially increasing COVID spread. Employees also have asked for pay increases. Walmart has increased wages for its employees, but not for its frontline retail store workers. It did gave bonuses to its hourly workers and hired 150000 temporary staffers.
