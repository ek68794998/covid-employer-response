  - summary: Bird was widely criticized for their poor handling of the company's layoffs. This was primarily due to the fact that the call lasted only two of the scheduled 30 minutes, and that the executive on the call was unidentified, had a "robotic" voice, and did not take any questions; this led to speculation that it was a recording, and not a live person. This event came on the heels of historical incidents wherein executives had sworn at employees or pulled pranks on them, pretending to fire them over Slack.
