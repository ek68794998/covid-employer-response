  - summary: Darden implemented a sick-leave policy in light of COVID-19, allowing employees to take 1 hour of leave for every 30 hours worked, based on the past 26 weeks of work. This means that full-time employees could receive as much as 35 hours of sick leave. However, newer workers could not use this sick leave until they had been employed for at least 90 days.
