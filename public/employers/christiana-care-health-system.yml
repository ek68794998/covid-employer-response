  - summary: Statements by employees at ChristianaCare subsidiaries say that caregivers working with COVID-19 patients have been forbidden to wear N95 respirators, saying, "It was written on our huddle board in the morning that airborne precautions are no longer needed." This is backed by an official statement from the chief infection prevention officer, saying the data "really doesn't support that using an N95 is necessary." This decision was apparently made based on data from the WHO and the CDC, despite the CDC issuing a statement telling all individuals to wear facial protection.
