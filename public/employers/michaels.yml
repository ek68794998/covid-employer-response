  - summary: Michaels claimed that it was essential due to providing supplies to small businesses and teachers, and helping people who "are looking to take their minds off a stressful reality." Michaels was served a cease-and-desist in Illinois after remaining open despite being non-essential during the stay-at-home order. Michaels since complied with the order and closed their doors in most states.
