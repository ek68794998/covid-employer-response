  - summary: Michaels remained open in several states, claiming that it was essential due to providing supplies to small businesses and teachers, and helping people who "are looking to take their minds off a stressful reality." Michaels was served a cease-and-desist in Illinois after remaining open despite being non-essential during the stay-at-home order. Michaels has since complied with the order and closed their doors.
