  - summary: Beyond its nature as "essential", Tyson found itself pressured to keep factories open due to the massive consolidation of meat-processing plants across the US. As of April 29, Tyson owned four of the 12 total shuttered meat-processing plants nationwide, which resulted in decreases of beef and pork production by 10% and 25% respectively.
