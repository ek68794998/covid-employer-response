summary: Though Joann Fabrics has a fairly standard policy of providing two weeks of sick leave to employees with a COVID-19 diagnosis, they also wrongfully called themselves an essential business and received orders in two states to shut down.
citations:
  - summary: Joann Fabrics initially claimed that they had to remain open due to providing mask kits to local hospitals, and had employees show up for work, violating Illinois' stay-at-home orders. They were since served a cease-and-desist and their request to be marked as "essential" was rejected by the Attorney General of Michigan. Joann Fabrics complied with the orders and shut down its stores during the pandemic.
