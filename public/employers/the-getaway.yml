  - summary: The owner of The Getaway sent a video internally to employees, notably while relaxing in beach clothing, calling them "dramatic" and suggesting not only that "didn't have to pay" their employees once the shutdown began, but that "by now," workers should be registered for unemployment or working in retail locations such as CVS.

# Original post content for the Facebook apology issued by The Getaway is below. The text is unaltered, but has had line breaks added.
#   Good Evening Everyone- due to the responses to an internal management video that has been twisted into something very
#   negative and grossly misunderstood by the general public and was solely meant to honestly and genuinely communicate
#   with our great staff, we would like to let everyone know that we have paid everyone on our staff. Like most other
#   businesses struggling in these times we are working through the challenges. We are planning, like everyone else, to
#   bring all of our staff back once we can. Thank you to the many that have supported us thru this.
