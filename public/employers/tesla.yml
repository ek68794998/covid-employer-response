  - summary: Elon Musk announced a repurposing of Tesla's solar-panel factory in New York to produce ventilators to combat COVID-19. Nothing more was heard of this plan until April 7, when Tesla showed off its new ventilator prototypes. On April 17, Tesla delivered a number of ventilators to hospitals; though they were not quite what the hospitals needed, they were able to adjust and make use of them.
