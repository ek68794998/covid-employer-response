      What are employer claims and reports?
    </h2>
    <p>
      An 
      <strong>
        employer claim
      </strong>
       is one or more declarations about an employer which include a summary and citations to back it up. This appears as a single bullet-point in the employer's listing beneath a header such as "
      ƥúβℓïçáƭïôñ
      ".
    </p>
    <p>
      An 
      <strong>
        employer report
      </strong>
       is a collection of claims about an employer as well as an overall rating of how well that employer has handled the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
    </p>
    <h2

      How do claims get processed?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once a claim is submitted, it must be reviewed by a contributor to the project before it will be approved and appear on the site. This review process will require the contributor to go through each of the sources and validate that the claim made is substantiated by the source. Once the submitter and contributor(s) agree on the submitted information, the claim is completed and will appear the next time the site is updated.

      How do I add, change, or dispute claims?
    </h2>
    <p>
      To submit a claim change of any kind, please click the "
      ƨúβ₥ïƭ
      " link in the navigation menu. From there, you can either submit a request for someone to update our data files, or submit a GitHub pull request to update the files yourself.

      What determines the rating of an employer?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ratings are algorithmically determined based on the positivity and negativity of the claims that it has. Claims that are more safety-critical have a higher weight than those which are not, and thus are not factored as heavily.
